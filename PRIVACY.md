Auto Invoice Sorter is a Google Workspace add-on that automatically identifies, sorts, and renames invoice files in Google Drive.

- **Data Access**: The add-on reads file metadata (names, parent folders, created/modified times) from Google Drive to identify and sort invoices. No file content is accessed or stored.
- **Data Storage**: Processing logs are stored in Script Properties. No file content is stored permanently.
- **Data Sharing**: No data is sent to or shared with third parties. All processing happens within Google's infrastructure.
- **File Operations**: The add-on moves and renames files within Drive to organize them into vendor folders.
- **Logging**: Operational logs are written to Apps Script Logger for troubleshooting. Sort actions are logged for audit purposes.
- **Removal**: Remove stored logs and settings by uninstalling the add-on or clearing Script Properties.
- **Support**: For privacy questions, open an issue in the repository or contact support@tangentforge.com.
